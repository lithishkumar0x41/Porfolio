  Bug bounty hunting has become an increasingly popular practice in the field of cybersecurity. Companies are turning to skilled professionals like myself to help identify and eliminate vulnerabilities in their web applications, mobile applications, and APIs. As an API security architect, VAPT specialist, and penetration tester with extensive experience working with Linux systems, I am well-equipped to provide comprehensive and effective solutions to a wide range of security issues.</br></br></br>

  One of the key advantages of bug bounty hunting is that it allows companies to tap into the expertise of a wide range of security professionals. By offering rewards for identifying and reporting vulnerabilities, companies can attract skilled hackers and cybersecurity enthusiasts who may be able to uncover weaknesses that their in-house security teams may have missed. This approach can help companies to stay ahead of emerging threats and improve their overall security posture.</br></br></br>

  As a bug bounty hunter, I specialize in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, mobile applications, and APIs. This involves a combination of manual testing, automated scanning, and other advanced techniques to identify weaknesses in software systems. Once vulnerabilities are identified, I work closely with clients to develop effective remediation plans to address the issues and prevent future attacks.</br></br></br>

  My expertise in Linux systems is also a key asset in this field, as many web applications and APIs run on Linux servers. By understanding the unique security challenges presented by these systems, I am able to provide more targeted and effective security solutions to my clients.</br></br></br>

  Overall, bug bounty hunting is an important and rapidly growing field in cybersecurity. By working with skilled professionals like myself, companies can better protect their digital assets and stay ahead of emerging threats in an increasingly complex and dangerous online environment.</br></br></br>

  I also built some tools which are helpful for individual pentesters.<br /><br /><br />You can checkout
